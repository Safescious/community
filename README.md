# Community
A curated list of established safety/well-being/performance companies. The criteria for inclusion are intentionally vague, but the general idea is to include only established companies for which a significant portion of the mission focuses on safety and/or consciousness or both. <i>Established</i> means that each company is either well-funded or profitable.

<i>Updates to inclusion criteria:</i>
2020-05: To make this list more useful to a global audience, companies that don't hire engineers across multiple timezone regions are no longer included. The timezone regions are roughly: Americas, Europe-Africa, and Asia-Pacific.

Pull requests are welcome. If you are a founder or a manager and you want to use the Safescious platform as a launchpad, please add your. Please keep the list in alphabetical order.

<b>Note:</b> we started this list as a way of finding companies that the Safescious community may want to learn from, to support or to work with. These days, we are busy building great content for you!
