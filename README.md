# Community
Our community
A curated list of established safety/well-being/performance companies. The criteria for inclusion are intentionally vague, but the general idea is to include only established companies for which a significant portion of the mission focuses on safety and/or consciousness or both. Established means that each company is either well-funded or profitable.

Pull requests are welcome. If you are a creator or a founder and you want to use the Safescious platform, please add yourPlease keep the list in alphabetical order.

<b>Note:</b> we started this list as a way of finding companies that the Safescious community may want to learn from, to join or to work with. These days, we are busy building great content for you!.
